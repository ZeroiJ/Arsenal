# Project TODO

Here's a list of tasks to further develop the Destiny companion app without direct Bungie API integration.

## Frontend Development (using Mock Data)

*   **Create Mock Data:**
    *   Generate realistic mock data for items (weapons, armor, etc.), including stats, perks, and other relevant details.
    *   Create mock data for characters, including their inventory, equipped items, and other relevant information.
    *   Simulate API responses for various actions, such as transferring items, equipping items, and dismantling items.

*   **Implement State Management:**
    *   Set up a state management solution (e.g., React Context, Redux) to handle the application's state.
    *   Manage the flow of data between components, ensuring consistency and predictability.

*   **Build Out UI Interactions:**
    *   Implement the logic for selecting an item in the inventory and displaying its details.
    *   Enable equipping an item from the inventory and have it appear in the equipment slots.
    *   Implement the functionality for transferring items between characters and the vault.

*   **Add New Features:**
    *   **Loadout Builder:** Create a feature that allows users to create and save custom loadouts.
    *   **Collections Tracker:** Develop a component to track the user's progress on in-game collections.
    *   **Vendor Inspector:** Build a feature to display the inventory of in-game vendors.

## Backend and Scalability Plan

To support a real user base and scale to a large number of players, a backend is required.

- [ ] **Define Scalability Goals:**
    - [ ] Clarify the "500k players" goal. Is it monthly active users or concurrent users? This decision will significantly impact architecture choices.

- [ ] **Backend Development:**
    - [ ] **Choose Technology Stack:** Select a backend language and framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with FastAPI, Go).
    - [ ] **Design API:** Define the API endpoints that the React application will use to fetch and modify data (e.g., `/api/user`, `/api/character/:characterId/inventory`).
    - [ ] **Build the Server:** Develop the core backend application logic.
    - [ ] **Implement Authentication:** Add user registration, login, and session management.

- [ ] **Database:**
    - [ ] **Choose Database:** Select a database that fits your data model and scalability needs (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    - [ ] **Integrate with Backend:** Connect the database to your backend server to store and retrieve all player and game data.

- [ ] **Deployment and Infrastructure:**
    - [ ] **Choose Hosting Platform:** Select a cloud provider for your backend and database (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku, Render).
    - [ ] **Deploy Backend:** Set up a deployment pipeline for your backend application.

- [ ] **Frontend Integration:**
    - [ ] **Connect to API:** Replace the mock data in your React application with live API calls to your new backend.

- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] **Load Testing:** Before launch, simulate high traffic to your backend to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.
